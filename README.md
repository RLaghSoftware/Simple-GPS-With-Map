# Simple-GPS-With-Map
This program displays a pre made map and allows a user to enter the labels for the destination and starting location, before displaying the path that should be taken to reach the destination.

Update: While the files uploaded needed to originally be ran together, the "run with one file" is a single file which can run the entire Java program by itself, simplifying the review process.
